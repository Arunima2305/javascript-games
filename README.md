This repository showcases two interactive projects created to develop my skills
in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: a Tic Tac Toe game and a Stone Paper Scissors game.
The Tic Tac Toe game features an intuitive UI, winner detection, and reset functionality, 
while the Stone Paper Scissors game includes a single-player mode against the computer with score tracking.
These projects helped to improve my skills in front-end web development, including responsive design and game logic implementation.
